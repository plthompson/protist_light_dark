This repository contains the scripts used to produce the results presented in this manscript. 

Scripts 1-4 run the data analysis of the raw video files and estimate the population sizes of the species at the different time points. This process takes months of computer processing and so we have not provided the raw data that feeds into this process. 

Instead we provide the output file pop_data2.RData that is the output of these four scripts. 

Script 5_protist_analysis.R uses this processed data to produce the figures and results presented in the manuscript.
